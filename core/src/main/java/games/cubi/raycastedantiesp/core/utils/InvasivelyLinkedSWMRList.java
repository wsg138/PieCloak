/**
 * An intrusive doubly linked node designed for a single-writer,
 * multiple-reader access pattern.
 *
 * <h2>Concurrency model</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Exactly one writer may modify a list.</li>
 *     <li>Readers may traverse forward concurrently.</li>
 *     <li>Readers must not inspect {@code previousWriterOnly()}.</li>
 *     <li>The writer must not reuse a removed node until all readers that
 *         could still hold that node have quiesced.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Forward links are published with release semantics and read with
 * acquire semantics. The backward link is plain because only the writer
 * may access it.</p>
 *
 * <p>A common layout uses a permanent sentinel node. Data nodes are placed
 * after the sentinel, and the sentinel itself is never unlinked.</p>
