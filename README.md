RaycastedAntiESP is a packet-based plugin for Paper, Folia, and its forks that hides entities (including players) and tile entities (blocks such as chests, banners, signs, etc) from players if they would not be visible to a legitimate player. It is **unbypassable** by design, as packets sent by the server are blocked from reaching the client unless the block/entity has been confirmed to be visible.
This limits the usefulness of unfair advantages such as cheat clients, freecam, and x-ray, and completely blocks pie-ray.

### Supported Versions
While the current "stable" plugin version is v1.6.5, it is strongly recommended that you use the [alpha-channel builds](https://modrinth.com/plugin/raycasted-anti-esp/versions?c=alpha) instead. Since v1.6.5, RaycastedAntiESP has been:
- Renamed from RaycastedEntityOcclusions to RaycastedAntiESP
- Been almost completely rewritten to be faster and more correct

The supported minecraft versions are 1.21.4+. Only Paper and derivative software (including Folia/Canvas) is supported, not Spigot.

## Use cases:

- Prevent cheating (anti-esp hacks)
  - This is the plugin's primary purpose. 
  - Block usage of pie-ray to locate underground bases or farms.
  - Prevent mods such as mini-maps or cheat clients from displaying the locations of hidden entities.
- Increase client-side performance for low-end devices
  - Massive megabases containing hundreds of armour stands, item frames, banners etc can cause performance issues on low-end devices unable to process so many entities. Raycasted AntiESP will cull those entities for the client, reducing the number of entities to process.
- Reduce network load by limiting packets
  - With `keep-client-entity-when-hidden` set to true, running RaycastedAntiESP will significantly reduce the number of entity packets sent to the client.
  - While entity packets are only a small portion of network bandwidth, this will still have a measurable impact and may be useful on extremely bandwidth-limited servers.
    - Unless you are extremely limited by bandwidth, this will probably be unnoticeable.
- Hide nametags behind walls
  - Yes, this plugin is overkill for doing that, yes you can do it anyways.

## Configuration
RaycastedAntiESP has many configuration options. A full list with explanations can be found at https://raycastedantiesp.cubi.games/config/.
 
## Dependencies:
- Packetevents
  - Required for all features, as packets are intercepted and rewritten to make sure that clients never learn about anything they should not be able to see.

## Known issues:
- There will be a short delay once an entity should be visible before it appears, causing it to appear like it "popped" into view. Various config options exist to partially address this issue, though all such options necessarily weaken the plugin's ability to block cheaters.

## Versioning:
Note that the following versioning information only applies to v2 and beyond, and alpha versions of v2 start with a major version number of 0 rather than 2.

RaycastedAntiESP binaries are composed of four distinct modules: the core, Locatable-lib (used for platform-independent location objects), [CubiLogging](https://github.com/Cubicake/CubiLogging/tree/main), and a platform adapter.

Each of these has its own versioning system. Locatable-lib and the logging api both declare public apis, and follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver). The platform adapter and core do not declare public apis, and thus [cannot follow semantic versioning](https://semver.org/#spec-item-1). They still follow a major.minor.patch versioning system, but which version number increments is less deterministic. Generally, major version bumps will be for when significant refactoring or rewriting has occurred, or a very significant distinct feature has been added or removed. Minor version bumps will be for the addition/removal of smaller distinct features, while patch version bumps are for bug fixes and tweaks or minor addition/removals which are related to the features added/removed in the minor version bumps.

In addition to the versions for each module, there is also an overall version for each platform binary, which is the version that is advertised in the description and file name, and is used for update checks. This version is a combination of the core and platform adapter versions, in the format `{core version}-PlatformName-{platform adapter version}`. This allows all platforms to share the same first three version numbers, while still allowing for differences in the platform adapter versions.

### Special mentions:

- Strokkur424 and other contributors to [StrokkCommands](https://github.com/Strokkur424/StrokkCommands), an LGPL-licensed open-source annotation-based brigadier command tree generator.
  - While StrokkCommands is not essential for the functioning of the project, it makes handling commands infinitely easier.
- Retrooper, Booky10, and all other contributors to [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents), a GPL-licensed open-source library for handling minecraft packets.
  - PacketEvents is essential for the functioning of the plugin, as it allows for handling of packets across multiple platforms and Minecraft versions.
- All contributors to Paper and its upstream projects Spigot and Bukkit, without which none of this would be possible.

### Note about in-game attributions and other (A)GPL requirements:
The plugin includes the command `/raycastedantiespCredits`, which displays a list of all authors and contributors, the license and a link to the source code. It can be run by all players. This command is intended to satisfy the "preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions" requirement of the AGPLv3 license in an easily accessible way for all users of the plugin, including players on a multiplayer server. If you fork this repository and remove the command you must include some other easily accessible way for all users of your fork to view the same information, as required by the AGPLv3.

This command has been deliberately named a long and unwieldy name to avoid clashing with any commands your server may wish to add, and does not pose any risks to your server as there is no unfair advantage which can be gained due to knowledge of the plugin's existence on your server.

It is **illegal** to remove the credits without providing an alternative, equally prominent way for users to view the same information. If for some reason crediting people who have worked on a feature for your server for free is a problem for you, you can contact Cubicake on discord (@cubicake) or make an issue to discuss receiving a specially licensed version with all attributions, credits, and source code links removed.

Using external software such as a command-hiding plugin to hide the command is **still illegal**, so please do not try to circumvent the requirement to provide attributions, credits, and source code links to users of your server.

Requesting a custom license is also required if you wish to link (as defined by the AGPL) a closed source project to this project.

An example of a suitable alternative to the command would be a single book-gui or dialog which contains all attributions, licenses, disclaimers, and source code links for all programs used by the server as long as the gui is easily accessible to all users of the server. Another example would be an NPC placed somewhere at your server's spawn which provides the information, as long as the NPC is not hidden somewhere difficult to access.

## Contributions:
Contributions via pull requests are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Forking:

Please see the [AGPLv3 license](LICENSE)—especially section 5, section 7, and section 13—before forking this repository, as there are some specific legal requirements for forks. 

In summary, translated into layman, plugin-specific terms, the most important requirements for forks are as follows:
1. Forks must not remove any names currently present in the authors/contributors list in the plugin's description, as this falls under the "preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions".
2. Forks must not claim to be the original software, as this falls under the "no misrepresentation of the origin of the material".
3. Per section 5 subsection c, derivative works such as forks must remain licenced under AGPLv3, and must include a copy of the license with the work. To be clear, copying any non-trivial amount of code from this repository into your own repository, whether via making a fork, directly copying and pasting or other means, makes it a derivative work and obligates you to license your derivative work under the AGPL v3. You must then include a copy of the license and make the source code (not decompiled code) accessible to all users of your program, explicitly including players on a multiplayer server as well as the server owners.
4. "Appropriate Legal Notices" such as the copyright notice, license notice, disclaimer, and link to the source code must be preserved. Currently this is implemented via the `/raycastedantiespCredits` command, and while you are not obligated to keep this specific implementation, if you remove the command you must provide an equally prominent way for all users of the plugin (including players on a multiplayer server) to easily view the same information.

`games.cubi.raycastedantiesp.paper.commands.Attribution` has been written with forks in mind, and a template has been left for forks to modify so that the AGPLv3 license can be obeyed with minimal effort.
